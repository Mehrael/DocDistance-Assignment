        Given: two documents D1 & D2
        Req.: Calculate distance between them d(D1, D2)? 
                 CASE INSENSITIVE
Apps:
        Search for similar documents
        Detecting duplicates (e.g. Wikipedia mirrors)
        Plagiarism detection
Definitions:
      Word = sequence of alpha-numeric characters ONLY
      Document = sequence of words (ignore space, punctuation, …etc.) 
      Treat all upper-case letters as if they are lower-case, so “Cat" & “cat" are same
      Word end at a non-alphanumeric char, so "can't" contains 2 words: "can" & "t"
